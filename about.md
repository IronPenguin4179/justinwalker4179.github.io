My name is Justin Walker. I am a born and raised Californian and self taught Software Developer. I've worked in construction and the oil fields doing field work all across America.

I have been programming for 3 years now. I'm best at Python and Ruby and love both languages. I'm also experienced with JavaScript, but not as much as the other two.

I've also made projects with
* C# with Unity Engine
* AngularJS
* React.js / Enzyme / Jest
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* TDD and Github

Basic skills
* Java
* C++


Outside of work and school I've been a video gamer since I was a toddler. I regularly play and run games of Pathfinder, Dungeons & Dragons and paint miniatures for board games. Most of all I am an avid movie buff who constantly seeks out the most fascinating films nobody has heard of and share them with whomever will watch.
