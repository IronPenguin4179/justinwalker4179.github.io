short-description: Python app for project scanning
---
Realize is a completely Python program designed to scan through a project and all its non standard lib imports to find class names, locations, and methods. Designed as my first personal open source project. It helped me learn the intricacies of Python's class
structure, inhereitance, and tkinter UI.
