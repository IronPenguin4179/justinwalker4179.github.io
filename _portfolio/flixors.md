short-description: IMDB clone made with React.js
---
Flixors is an IMDB clone made with React.js. Designed as a final project to use any framework to make
a website similar to IMDB for retrieving tv show info. I chose React to test my ability to learn a
completely new framework as fast as possible. I learned React and made the project in 5 days.
