title: "Google: A Programmer's Super Weapon"
---

I don't yet have a lot of experience in software development, but I'm learning more everyday. I'm learning that programming is a field that requires constant communication among its practitioners. I spent a brief time working with and around various kinds of engineers and noticed that they often consult their piers to solve problems, but they typically only ask others locally. A person would typically ask their coworkers or superiors, but rarely would consult another random engineer they'd never met. In programming, however, we consult the entire community for solutions to problems ranging from the most advanced theoretical issues to the most basic of commands. All of this is done with the super powerful resource, Google.

Any issue is most likely solvable by perusing Stack Overflow and seeing other people you'll never meet debate the exact topic you're interested in. It was one of the more difficult things for me to adjust to when I started studying for this field. In school I was constantly taught to avoid googling the answers to my problems, but for programmers, discerning the many claims and posts of the internet community is actually an expected skill. Part of what makes a good programmer is his or her ability to learn new material quickly through the internet, to become as quick and efficient with learning from Google as a carpenter is precise with his hammer. Even now with my current curriculum with Bloc, I'm expected to ask my Mentor questions when I get stuck, but the majority of the time I can answer it more quickly by reading an appropriate forum. 

The other undeniable strength of Google is connecting programmers to complete lists of documentation. With so many coding languages constantly being updated and evolving, the fact that we can search for the proper documentation is endlessly useful. For a student like me, it is especially helpful to be able to Google the full explanation and usage of every command or term I don't fully understand. I begin coding in a new language, or with a new tool, and can consult the documentation for various commands, look at a forum for how to use it, find a new command I don't recognize, consult the documentation again, and rinse and repeat. By the end of a short page of code, I've learned several commands, better understand the ones I already knew causing me to improve my knowledge and skill with every new search.

Google's use to the computer science community is obvious those who have spent time in it, but not as obvious to outsiders. My friends and family think I'm blowing them off when I tell them google solves all my problems, so I wrote this post to enlighten them and any who are new to the field.
